## üéÆ Experience Point (XP) System

### XP Rewards
- **Service Completed**: 50 XP (base)
- **High Rating Bonus**: +20 XP (for 5-star ratings)
- **First Service Bonus**: +30 XP (one-time)
- **Consecutive Services**: +10 XP per consecutive day
- **Perfect Week**: +100 XP (5+ services in a week with 5-star ratings)

### XP Calculation Formula
```typescript
totalXP = BASE_XP 
        + (rating === 5 ? HIGH_RATING_BONUS : 0)
        + (isFirstService ? FIRST_SERVICE_BONUS : 0)
        + (consecutiveDays > 1 ? CONSECUTIVE_BONUS * (consecutiveDays - 1) : 0)
```

### Level Progression
Users automatically level up when they reach the minimum XP threshold for the next level. Level-ups trigger:
1. Immediate notification in transaction history
2. Unlock of all perks for that level
3. Update of user's level badge across the platform
4. Potential unlock of custom pricing (at Level 5)

## üí∞ Custom Pricing Feature (Level 5+)

### How It Works
- **Requirement**: Reach Level 5 (1000 XP, 25 services completed)
- **Status Field**: `user.custom_credits_enabled` set to `true`
- **UI Indicator**: Gold badge in ServiceModal showing "üèÜ Level X - Custom Pricing Unlocked"

### ServiceModal Behavior
**Before Level 5:**
```
üîí Default Rate: 1.0 credit/hr
Reach Level 5 (25 services completed) to unlock custom pricing!
Current: Level X ‚Ä¢ Services: Y/25
```

**After Level 5:**
```
üèÜ Level 5 - Custom Pricing Unlocked
[Input field with number validation, min 0.5, step 0.5]
‚ú® You can set your own rate! Your level perks give you pricing freedom.
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
```typescript
export interface User {
  // ... existing fields
  level?: number;
  experience_points?: number;
  services_completed?: number;
  custom_credits_enabled?: boolean;
}

export interface UserLevel {
  level: number;
  title: string;
  minExperience: number;
  maxExperience: number;
  servicesRequired: number;
  perks: LevelPerk[];
  badge: string;
  color: string;
}

export interface LevelPerk {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  type: 'visibility' | 'credits' | 'custom_pricing' | 'priority' | 'badge' | 'discount';
  value?: number | string;
}

export interface LevelProgress {
  currentLevel: number;
  currentExperience: number;
  experienceToNextLevel: number;
  progressPercentage: number;
  servicesCompleted: number;
  nextLevel?: UserLevel;
  unlockedPerks: LevelPerk[];
}
```

### Core Service (`src/services/levelService.ts`)
**Key Functions**:
- `calculateLevel(experience)` - Determines level from XP
- `getLevelProgress(experience, services)` - Returns full progress object
- `calculateServiceExperience(rating, isFirst, consecutive)` - Calculates XP for service
- `applyLevelBonus(baseCredits, level)` - Applies credit bonus
- `applyLevelDiscount(baseCredits, level)` - Applies service discount
- `canUseCustomPricing(level)` - Checks if level >= 5

### Data Service Integration (`src/services/dataService.ts`)
**updateBooking Function Enhancement**:
```typescript
// When booking status becomes 'completed':
1. Calculate base credits from service rate
2. Apply level bonus: earnedCredits = applyLevelBonus(baseCredits, provider.level)
3. Update provider credits with bonus
4. Calculate XP reward: calculateServiceExperience(rating, isFirst, consecutive)
5. Update provider: experience_points, services_completed, level
6. Check and enable custom_credits_enabled if level >= 5
7. Create transaction with bonus notation
8. Create level-up notification if level increased
```

## üéØ Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Level Badge**: Primary indicator of user status
2. **Progress Bar**: Visual motivation for next level
3. **Perk Cards**: Tangible benefits display
4. **Color Coding**: Instant level recognition

### Gamification Strategy
1. **Clear Goals**: Explicit service count requirements
2. **Visible Progress**: Real-time XP tracking
3. **Meaningful Rewards**: Actual economic benefits
4. **Status Symbols**: Badges and titles for social proof
5. **Escalating Benefits**: Each level significantly better than previous

### Performance Considerations
- Level calculations cached in user object
- Progress bars use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
- Badge components memoized with React.memo
- XP updates batched with booking completion

  // ... existing fields
  level: 1,
  experience_points: 0,
  services_completed: 0,
  custom_credits_enabled: false,
  level_history: [
    { level: 2, unlocked_at: timestamp, services_at_unlock: 3 }

# Chat & Booking Notification Features - Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Chat Message Storage & Display
**Problem**: Messages weren't showing after sending in ChatWindow.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive debug logging to trace the E2EE flow
- Fixed shared key derivation polling logic that was checking stale state
- Enhanced message subscription callback with logging
- Improved error handling for decryption failures

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Chat/ChatWindow.tsx`
  - Added console logs for key derivation, message subscription, and decryption
  - Fixed polling interval to properly track derivation success
  - Messages now decrypt and display correctly in real-time

### 2. Added Chat Button Beside Book Now
**Feature**: Users can now chat with providers directly from service cards.

**Implementation**:
- Added "Chat" button next to "Book Now" in service cards
- Button opens ChatWindow modal with provider and service context
- State management via `chatPeer` for modal control

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Services/ServiceList.tsx`
  - Added `chatPeer` state to track chat modal
  - Added Chat button UI (blue styled, beside Book Now)
  - Wired ChatWindow modal at component bottom
  - Button only visible for services from other users

### 3. Real-Time Booking Notifications for Providers
**Feature**: Providers receive instant toast notifications when users book their services.

**Implementation**:
#### a. Toast Notification System
- Created reusable Toast component with animations
- Built ToastContext for global toast management
- Added slide-in-right animation in CSS
- Supports success, error, info, and booking types

**New Files**:
- `src/components/Notifications/Toast.tsx` - Toast UI component
- `src/contexts/ToastContext.tsx` - Global toast state & API
- Animation CSS added to `src/index.css`

#### b. Booking Notification Service
- Firestore real-time listener for provider bookings
- Filters for truly new bookings (avoids duplicate notifications on page load)
- Subscribes to pending bookings with timestamps

**New Files**:
- `src/services/bookingNotificationService.ts`
  - `subscribeToProviderBookings()` - Real-time Firestore subscription
  - Tracks last seen timestamp to detect new vs. existing bookings
  - Returns unsubscribe function for cleanup

#### c. App Integration
- Wrapped entire app with ToastProvider in `main.tsx`
- Added booking notification listener in App.tsx
- Displays toast with requester name and service title
- Optional notification sound (base64 encoded beep)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main.tsx` - Added ToastProvider wrapper
- `src/App.tsx` - Imported useToast & bookingNotificationService, added useEffect listener
- `src/index.css` - Added slide-in-right keyframe animation

## How It Works

### Chat Flow
1. User clicks "Chat" button on a service card
2. ChatWindow opens with E2EE enabled
3. Both users' public keys are exchanged via Firestore
4. Shared AES-GCM key is derived using ECDH
5. Messages are encrypted client-side before sending
6. Messages decrypt on recipient's device in real-time
7. Console logs help debug key derivation and message flow

### Booking Notification Flow
1. User books a service (creates booking with `status: 'pending'`)
2. Firestore listener detects the new booking document
3. Service checks if booking is truly new (after baseline timestamp)
4. Toast notification appears in top-right corner
5. Notification includes requester name and service title
6. Auto-dismisses after 8 seconds (or user can close manually)
7. Provider can navigate to Bookings view to accept/decline

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Chat Messages**: Send messages between two users; verify real-time delivery and decryption
- [ ] **Chat Button**: Click Chat from service card; modal opens with correct provider
- [ ] **Booking Notification**: Book a service; provider sees toast notification
- [ ] **Toast Animations**: Notification slides in from right smoothly
- [ ] **Multiple Notifications**: Book multiple services; toasts stack vertically
- [ ] **Firebase Mode**: Test with Firebase configured (real-time updates)
- [ ] **Local Mode**: Test with mock data (localStorage fallback)

## Environment Requirements

- **Firebase** (optional but recommended for real-time features):
  - Firestore database with `chats`, `bookings` collections
  - Indexes on `bookings` for `provider_id + status + created_at`
  
- **Local Fallback**: All features work with localStorage if Firebase not configured

## Known Limitations

- Booking notifications only work with Firebase (no local polling)
- Toast notifications don't persist across page refreshes
- Sound notification may be blocked by browser autoplay policies

## Future Enhancements

1. **Provider-Only Agree Button**: Gate the "Agree" button to only show for providers
2. **Booking Form Prefill**: Auto-populate booking form when provider agrees in chat
3. **Persistent Notifications**: Store notification history in Firestore
4. **Read Receipts**: Show when peer has seen messages
5. **Typing Indicators**: Real-time "peer is typing..." status

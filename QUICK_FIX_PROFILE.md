## üìä What I Need

If it still doesn't work, tell me:

1. **What error message** you see in console (exact text)

4. **Screenshot** of console errors (optional but helpful)

## üí° Most Likely Issues

### Issue: User State Lost
**Symptom**: Alert says "No user session found"  
**Why**: React state cleared but localStorage still has user  
**Fix**: Logout, clear storage, login again

### Issue: Demo Account Missing
**Symptom**: "User not found in mockUsers"  
**Why**: localStorage doesn't have level5-demo user  
**Fix**: Clear localStorage, reload, login

### Issue: Firebase Blocking
**Symptom**: "Missing or insufficient permissions"  
**Why**: Still trying to use Firebase for demo account  
**Fix**: Already fixed in code, but clear cache and reload

## ‚úÖ Current Code Status

The following fixes are already in place:

1. ‚úÖ Demo account detection in AuthContext
2. ‚úÖ localStorage-only updates for demo accounts
3. ‚úÖ Comprehensive console logging
4. ‚úÖ Better error messages
5. ‚úÖ Error stack traces for debugging

**All code fixes are complete.** If save still fails, it's likely a:
- User state issue (logout/login fixes it)
- localStorage corruption (clear storage fixes it)
- Console error we haven't seen yet (share it!)

## Technical Details

### Mock Data Location
Both accounts are defined in `src/services/mockData.ts`:
- User objects with full profile data
- Time credit balances initialized
- Level, XP, and service counts pre-set

### Authentication Logic
Handled in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:
- Hardcoded credentials for quick access
- Works in both Firebase and mock modes
- Falls back to these accounts if Firebase auth fails

### UI Components
Level demo buttons added to:
- `src/components/Auth/LoginForm.tsx` (lines ~480-545)
- `src/components/Auth/RegisterForm.tsx` (lines ~150-180)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error
- Ensure you're using the exact email and password listed above
- Check that you're in the "Email" tab, not "Phone" tab
- Try using the quick login buttons instead

### Can't see custom pricing option
- Confirm you're logged in as Level 5 or Level 7 account
- Check profile page shows correct level (5 or 7)
- Try logging out and logging back in
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Changes not saving
- Ensure mock data mode is active (check browser console)
- Changes may not persist across browser refreshes in mock mode
- For persistent data, configure Firebase backend
